        question: "What is Home Loan?",
        answer: "A home loan is a secured loan that is obtained to purchase a property by offering it as collateral. The property can be an under-construction property, a ready-built purchase from the builder/developer, the purchase of a resale property, the construction of a house on a plot, the extension of an existing house, the repair/renovation of an existing flat/house, or the transfer of your existing home loan from another bank or financial institution to LIC Housing Finance Ltd. The home loan is repaid through EMIs. After repayment, the property's title is transferred back to the borrower."

    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "How is the EMI for my loan calculated?",
        answer: "The Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) is calculated using a formula that takes into account the loan principal, the interest rate, and the loan tenure. The formula is: EMI = P × r × ((1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1) where P is the principal, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of months."

    {
        id: 6,
        question: "What is the difference between a fixed rate of interest and a floating rate of interest?",
